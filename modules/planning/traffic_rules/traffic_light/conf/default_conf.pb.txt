# stop_distance defines the maximum allowed distance from the stop line.
# The vehicle will target a preferred distance within this limit.
# Updated for ISCC 2025: 1.7m (target bumper distance) + 2.151m (front_edge_to_center) = 3.851m
# This places the bumper within the 1.5-2.0m scoring window for red light straight stopping
